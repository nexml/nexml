the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and
RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will
be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and
inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to establish
such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology representation
languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the...},

E-Business. An efficient collaboration between different participants in E-Business

thus, is only possible, when business partners agree on a common syntax and have a

common understanding of the basic concepts in the domain. XML covers the syntactic

level, but lacks support for efficient sharing of conceptualizations. The Web Ontology
