<!-- TITLE: NeXML - phylogenetic data as xml -->
<!-- HEADING: Overview -->
<p>
    The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/rvosa/article/2011773">
    NEXUS file format</a> is a commonly used format for
    phylogenetic data. Unfortunately, over time, the format
    has become overloaded - which has caused various
    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/NEXUS_Problems">
    problems</a>. Meanwhile, new technologies around the
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> standard have
    emerged. These technologies have the potential to greatly
    simplify, and improve robustness, in the processing of rich phylogenetic data.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="rss">
    <strong>Syntax validation</strong> &mdash; some of the issues hampering
    interoperability are caused by the fact that no formal
    specification exists for NEXUS and other flat files, and no unambiguous way
    to validate them. Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">
    XML Schema</a> we can now define a grammar against which
    data files can be validated syntactically.
</li>
<li class="rss">
	<strong>Semantic annotation</strong> &mdash; another issue in current file
	formats is that their semantics are not well-defined. For example, what does
	it mean to use an ambiguity code in a matrix? Is it uncertainty or polymorphism?
	With the wider <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/">
    EvoInfo working group</a> we are developing an <a href="http://www.evolutionaryontology.org">
    ontology</a> on which we are mapping NeXML schema types so that the semantics
    of data files become well-defined.
</li>
<li class="rss">
    <strong>Web services</strong> &mdash; a number of different
    technologies (such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>,
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
    and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP</a>) have
    emerged allowing disparate, xml-based services to be glued together
    over the internet. Using such services, researchers can
    "farm out" their calculations to dedicated servers, such
    as those of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.phylo.org">CIPRES
    project</a>. The wider plan is to integrate such services in
    an <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/General_Ontology">ontology</a>-mediated 
    architecture.
</li>
<!--li class="rss">
    <strong>Native XML databases</strong> &mdash; relational
    databases are based on a fixed schema. For phylogenetic
    data this poses problems, because the field of phyloinformatics
    moves very rapidly: new metrics and analysis types are
    published constantly.
    <a rel="nofollow" href="http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/">XML databases</a>
    are freed from this constraint, simplifying storage of
    unusual data types.
</li-->
</ul>
<p>
    Therefore, a group of developers of phylogenetic software have
    come together as part of the <a href="http://www.nescent.org">
    NESCent</a> working group for <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo">
    evolutionary informatics</a> to develop a
    <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/Future_Data_Exchange_Standard">
    new data exchange standard</a> based on these technologies.

    What are we doing about it?
</h3>
<p>
    NeXML development is being undertaken in a number of
    subprojects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rss">
        In the first place, we're designing an XML schema. This
        schema (designated as namespace http://www.nexml.org/2009)
        is documented on our
        <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/Future_Data_Exchange_Standard">wiki</a>;
        the bleeding edge version is available from <a href="/code">svn</a>;
        the <a href="/nexml/xsd">source code can be browsed</a> on our
        site (it's a check out from our repository which is updated
        every five minutes); for bug reports and feature requests please
        visit our <a href="/nexml/html/index/tracker">issue tracker</a>
        page.
    </li>
    <li class="rss">
        Secondly, we're implementing NeXML read/write abilities in a number of
        software packages:<br/>
