     * Protected constructors are intended for recursive parsing, i.e.
     * starting from the root element (which maps onto DocumentImpl) we
     * traverse the element tree such that for every child element that maps
     * onto an Impl class the containing class calls that child's protected
     * constructor, passes in the element of the child. From there the 
     * child takes over, populates itself and calls the protected 
     * constructors of its children. These should probably be protected
     * because there is all sorts of opportunity for outsiders to call
     * these in the wrong context, passing in the wrong elements etc.
     * @param document the containing DOM document object. Every Impl 
     * class needs a reference to this so that it can create DOM element
     * objects
     * @param element the equivalent NeXML element (e.g. for OTUsImpl, it's
     * the <otus/> element)
