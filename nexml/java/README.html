<p>
	This subdirectory contains java classes for nexml parsing,
	a mesquite extension that uses these classes (for mesquite's
	"import" facility) and a Xerces-J based validator. The validator
	is based on code written by Terri Liebowitz of the San Diego
	Supercomputing Center, and modified by Mark Holder. The parser
	classes and mesquite bindings were written by Rutger Vos.

	In addition to these classes, the nexml website also provides
	nexmlbeans.jar, a set of bindings created using 
	<a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/">Apache XML beans 2.3.0</a>
