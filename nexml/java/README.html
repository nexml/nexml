	This subdirectory contains java classes for nexml parsing.
	Specifically, the directory structure is as follows:
	<ul>
		<li class="rss">
			<code>org/</code> contains DOM-based dbhack deliverable.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			<code>mesquite/</code> contains classes for 
			<a href="http://mesquiteproject.org">mesquite</a>. 
			These classes use the org.nexml.* architecture, and so function
			to illustrate how to use it in an application.
			Written and maintained by Rutger Vos with some help
			from Wayne Maddison.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			<code>validator/</code> contains a 
			<a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/">Xerces-J</a>-based
			validator written by Terri Liebowitz of the San Diego
			Supercomputing Center, with modifications by Mark Holder.
			It is used to validate nexml instance documents against
			the schema (or, indeed, any xml instance document against
			any schema).
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	In addition to these classes, the nexml website also provides
	nexmlbeans.jar, a set of bindings created using 
	<a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/">Apache XML beans 2.3.0</a>
	in the <a href="http://www.nexml.org/nexml/downloads">downloads</a>
	section.
