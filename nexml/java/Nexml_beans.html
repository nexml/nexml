<p>
This file contains brief developer instructions for using the (as yet incomplete) nexmlbeans-based 
parser for Mesquite.
</p>

<p>
After checking out the project, setup Ant or your IDE to build mesquite.nexml.* and org.nexml.*, but
exclude mesquite.io.* (that contains the Sax parser, which is currently incomplete).  You will also
need to include all 7 jar files in the jars folder.  Don't forget to specify an output folder,
Mesquite_Folder is a suggested name.
</p>

<p>
Edit or create the classpaths.xml file in your ~/Mesquite_Support_Files folder.  Add the 7 jar files 
and the output folder to the classpaths list.  For example:
</p>


&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br>
&lt;mesquite&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/jsr173_1.0_api.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/nexmlbeans.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/resolver.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/xbean_xpath.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/xbean.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/xmlbeans-qname.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/jars/xmlpublic.jar&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
	&lt;classpath&gt/Users/peter/Projects/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project/Mesquite_Folder&lt/classpath&gt;<br>
&lt;/mesquite&gt;<br>

<br>
<p>
Replace "/Users/peter/Project/workspace/Nexmlbeans Project" with the appropriate path.
</p>

<p>
Now start Mesquite and check the log window to verify that Mesquite properly read the classpaths file.  Note that
this does not guarantee that the jar files were properly loaded - Mesquite does not immediately report problems with
loading the jar files.  Use the open dialog to open a Nexml file and when the list of interpreters appears, the
Nexml interpreter should appear at the bottom of the list.  If the file does not load or incompletely loads, check the
Mesquite log - problems with class loading frequently indicate problems with the jar files.  Other problems may be
bugs with the Nexml parser or simply that your file has elements which the parser doesn't handle yet.
