<!-- 
    You are strongly encouraged to hack this at will, naturally. Note that this readme shows up in 
    the directory listing web page at http://<% hostName %>/nexml/python - try to keep things marked 
    up as proper xhtml without too many style hacks so that it ends up looking consistent with the 
    rest of the site :)
    
    Also, once you've read this, this comment will selfdestruct in five seconds. I mean, feel free
    to remove it so that people downloading the code will get a clean looking readme without my
    logorrhea at the top.

    To install the pynexml library, end-users can run:
    <br />
    <code>$ python setup.py install</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    Developers, who are using the "cutting-edge" code via <code>svn</code> may
    prefer to use the develop command.  This installs an egg-link to the 
    path of the <code>nexml/python</code> directory in the appropriate 
    site-packages directory in your python installation.  Thus, you will not 
    have to reinstall after every change to the code:
    <br />
    <code>$ python setup.py develop</code>
    <br />
</p>
