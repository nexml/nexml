<p>
Ruby support for NeXML comes in the form of a <a href="http://www.bioruby.org">BioRuby</a> 
plugin, whose development was initiated by Anurag Priyam during the 2010 Google Summer
of Code. In Spring 2011, Rutger Vos refactored this into a 
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/bio-nexml">ruby gem (called 'bio-nexml')</a>, whose 
<a href="http://github.com/rvosa/bio-nexml">source code can be found
on github</a>. Documentation for the ruby gem can be found 
<a href="http://rvosa.github.com/bio-nexml/">here</a>.
