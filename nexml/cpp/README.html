	C++ bindings are generated from the <a href="../xsd">nexml schema files</a> using the <code>xsd</code>
	tool from <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml">CodeSynthesis</a>,
	and are then compiled with something like the <a href="driver.cxx">driver.cxx</a> file to yield 
	an executable that processes nexml instance documents (presumably this would be part of an importer
	that maps the beans objects created by the <code>xsd</code> tool onto your internal object model). 
	The basic steps are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li class="rss">
			<a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml">Download</a> and install 
			xsd-* for your platform.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">Download and install <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">xerces-c</a>,
			we need to include its headers during compiling and libxerces during linking.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			<p>
			Generate the headers and binding sources from the schema using the xsd tool.
			The easiest way to do this is to run the <code>configure</code> script in the parent directory
			and use make from that directory (if you are a developer, you will have to run
			the <code>bootstrap.sh</code> shell script to create the <code>configure</code> script -- you will
			also need up-to-date <code>autoconf</code> and <code>automake</code>).
			You will need to use the <code>--with-xerces=</code> and <code>--with-code-syn-xsd</code>
			arguments to <code>configure</code>
			</p>

			<p>
			If you do not want to use the configure-based build, you can also 
			build the C++ bindings using  something like this <a href="build.sh">shell
			script</a> or this <a href="handwrittenMakefile">Makefile</a>. You may have to tweak these a little
			depending on your install location and version for xsd and xerces-c.
			The salient point
			in these script examples is the command line invocation for <code>xsd</code>.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			Create your own mappings between the xsd object model and that of your software. The
			<a href="driver.cxx">driver.cxx</a> gives a simple example of where to start with that.
			Make sure to use the flags to include and link to xsd, and xerces.
			For example, compile with <code>-I$XERCES_HOME/include -I$XSD_HOME/$XSD_HOME/libxsd</code> and link with 
			<code>-L$XERCES_HOME/lib -lxerces-c</code>.

	</ul>
