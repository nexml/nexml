	C++ bindings are generated from the <a href="../xsd">nexml schema files</a> using the <code>xsd</code>
	tool from <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml">CodeSynthesis</a>,
	and are then compiled with something like the <a href="driver.cxx">driver.cxx</a> file to yield 
	an executable that processes nexml instance documents (presumably this would be part of an importer
	that maps the beans objects created by the <code>xsd</code> tool onto your internal object model). 
	The basic steps are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li class="rss">
			<a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml">Download</a> and install 
			xsd-* for your platform.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">Download and install <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">xerces-c</a>,
			we need to include its headers during compiling and libxerces during linking.
			For example, if <code>XERCES_HOME=~/xerces-c_2_8_0-x86-macosx-gcc_4_0</code>,
			compile with <code>-I$XERCES_HOME/include</code> and link with 
			<code>-L$XERCES_HOME/lib -lxerces-c</code>.		
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			Generate the headers and binding sources using something like this <a href="build.sh">shell
			script</a> or this <a href="makefile">makefile</a>. You may have to tweak these a little
			depending on your install location and version for xsd and xerces-c, the salient point
			in these script examples is the command line invocation for <code>xsd</code>.
		</li>
		<li class="rss">
			Create your own mappings between the xsd object model and that of your software. The
			<a href="driver.cxx">driver.cxx</a> gives a simple example of where to start with that.
		</li>
	</ul>
