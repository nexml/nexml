Bio::Phylo - An object-oriented Perl toolkit 
for analyzing and manipulating phyloinformatic data. 

DESCRIPTION

Phylogenetics is the branch of evolutionary biology
that deals with reconstructing and analyzing the 
tree of life. This distribution provides objects and
methods to aid in handling and analyzing phylogenetic
data.

COMPATABILITY
 
Bio::Phylo installs without problems on most popular,
current platforms (Win32, OSX, Linux, Solaris, IRIX,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD), on Perl versions >= 5.8.0

For a list of automated test results visit:

http://testers.cpan.org/show/Bio-Phylo.html

INSTALLATION

Bio::Phylo has the following required dependencies:
	Scalar::Util (core)
	Test::More (core)
	IO::File (core)
	IO::String (non-core, but installs everywhere)

And the following optional dependencies:
	SVG (to draw trees as SVG vector drawings)
	Math::Random (to simulate trees)
	XML::Twig (to parse nexml)

These modules are all available from
http://www.cpan.org, and should install without
problems on most platforms.
 
To install the Bio::Phylo distribution, run the
following commands: 

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
 
(For platform specific information on what 'make'
command to use, check "perl -V:make". On Win32 this
usually returns "make='nmake';", which means you'll
need the 'nmake' utility:
