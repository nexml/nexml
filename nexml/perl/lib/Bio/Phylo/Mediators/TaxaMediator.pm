=head1 NAME

Bio::Phylo::Mediators::TaxaMediator - Mediator for links between taxa and other objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # no direct usage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module manages links between taxon objects and other objects linked to 
them. It is an implementation of the Mediator design pattern (e.g. see 
L<Relationship Manager Pattern|http://www.atug.com/andypatterns/RM.htm>,
L<Mediator|http://home.earthlink.net/~huston2/dp/mediator.html>,
L<Mediator Design Pattern|http://sern.ucalgary.ca/courses/SENG/443/W02/assignments/Mediator/>).

Methods defined in this module are meant only for internal usage by Bio::Phylo.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

=over

=item new()

TaxaMediator constructor.

 Type    : Constructor
 Title   : new
 Usage   : my $mediator = Bio::Phylo::Taxa::TaxaMediator->new;
 Function: Instantiates a Bio::Phylo::Taxa::TaxaMediator
           object.
 Returns : A Bio::Phylo::Taxa::TaxaMediator object (singleton).
 Args    : None.

=cut

	sub new {

		# could be child class
		my $class = shift;

		# notify user
		$logger->info("constructor called for '$class'");

		# singleton class
		if ( not $self ) {
			$logger->debug("first time instantiation of singleton");
			$self = \$class;
			bless $self, $class;
		}

		return $self;

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item register()

Stores argument in invocant's cache.

 Type    : Method
 Title   : register
 Usage   : $mediator->register( $obj );
 Function: Stores an object in mediator's cache
 Returns : $self
 Args    : An object, $obj
 Comments: This method is called every time an object is instantiated.

=cut

	sub register {
		my ( $self, $obj ) = @_;

		my $id = $obj->get_id;
		
		# notify user
		$logger->info("registering object $obj ($id)");
		
		$object[$id] = $obj;
		weaken $object[$id];
		
		$logger->debug("done registering object $obj ($id)");
		return $self;
	}

=item unregister()

Removes argument from invocant's cache.

 Type    : Method
 Title   : unregister
 Usage   : $mediator->unregister( $obj );
 Function: Cleans up mediator's cache of $obj and $obj's relations
 Returns : $self
 Args    : An object, $obj
 Comments: This method is called every time an object is destroyed.

=cut

	sub unregister {
		my ( $self, $obj ) = @_;

		# notify user
		#$logger->info("unregistering object '$obj'"); # XXX

		my $id = $obj->get_id;
		if ( defined $id ) {
			if ( exists $object[$id] ) {
				
				# one-to-many relationship
				if ( exists $relationship[$id] ) {
					delete $relationship[$id];
				}
				else {
					
					# one-to-one relationship
				  LINK_SEARCH: for my $relation (@relationship) {
						if ( exists $relation->{$id} ) {	
							delete $relation->{$id};
							last LINK_SEARCH;
						}
					}
				}	
				delete $object[$id];
			}
		}
		return $self;
	}

=item set_link()

Creates link between objects.

 Type    : Method
 Title   : set_link
 Usage   : $mediator->set_link( -one => $obj1, -many => $obj2 );
 Function: Creates link between objects
 Returns : $self
 Args    : -one  => $obj1 (source of a one-to-many relationship)
           -many => $obj2 (target of a one-to-many relationship)
 Comments: This method is called from within, for example, set_taxa
           method calls. A call like $taxa->set_matrix( $matrix ),
           and likewise a call like $matrix->set_taxa( $taxa ), are 
           both internally rerouted to:

           $mediator->set_link( 
                -one  => $taxa, 
                -many => $matrix 
           );

=cut

	sub set_link {
		my $self = shift;
		my %opt  = @_;
		my ( $one, $many ) = ( $opt{'-one'}, $opt{'-many'} );
		my ( $one_id, $many_id ) = ( $one->get_id, $many->get_id );

		# notify user
		$logger->info("setting link between '$one' and '$many'");

		# delete any previously existing link
	  LINK_SEARCH: for my $relation (@relationship) {
			if ( exists $relation->{$many_id} ) {
				delete $relation->{$many_id};

				# notify user
				$logger->info("deleting previous link");

				last LINK_SEARCH;
			}
		}

		# initialize new hash if not exist
		$relationship[$one_id] = {} if not $relationship[$one_id];
		my $relation = $relationship[$one_id];

		# value is type so that can retrieve in get_link
		$relation->{$many_id} = $many->_type;

		return $self;

	}

=item get_link()

Retrieves link between objects.

 Type    : Method
 Title   : get_link
 Usage   : $mediator->get_link( 
               -source => $obj, 
               -type   => _CONSTANT_,
           );
 Function: Retrieves link between objects
 Returns : Linked object
 Args    : -source => $obj (required, the source of the link)
           -type   => a constant from Bio::Phylo::Util::CONSTANT

           (-type is optional, used to filter returned results in 
           one-to-many query).

 Comments: This method is called from within, for example, get_taxa
           method calls. A call like $matrix->get_taxa()
           and likewise a call like $forest->get_taxa(), are 
           both internally rerouted to:

           $mediator->get_link( 
               -source => $self # e.g. $matrix or $forest           
           );

           A call like $taxa->get_matrices() is rerouted to:

           $mediator->get_link( -source => $taxa, -type => _MATRIX_ );

=cut

	sub get_link {
		my $self = shift;
		my %opt  = @_;
		my $id   = $opt{'-source'}->get_id;

		# have to get many objects
		if ( defined $opt{'-type'} ) {
			my $relation = $relationship[$id];
			return if not $relation;
			my @result;
			for my $key ( keys %{$relation} ) {
				push @result, $object[$key]
				  if $relation->{$key} == $opt{'-type'};
			}
			return \@result;
		}
		else {
		  LINK_SEARCH: for my $i ( 0 .. $#relationship ) {
				my $relation = $relationship[$i];
				if ( exists $relation->{$id} ) {
					return $object[$i];
				}
			}
		}
	}

=item remove_link()

Removes link between objects.

 Type    : Method
 Title   : remove_link
 Usage   : $mediator->remove_link( -one => $obj1, -many => $obj2 );
 Function: Removes link between objects
 Returns : $self
 Args    : -one  => $obj1 (source of a one-to-many relationship)
           -many => $obj2 (target of a one-to-many relationship)

           (-many argument is optional)

 Comments: This method is called from within, for example, 
           unset_taxa method calls. A call like $matrix->unset_taxa() 
           is rerouted to:

           $mediator->remove_link( -many => $matrix );

           A call like $taxa->unset_matrix( $matrix ); is rerouted to:

           $mediator->remove_link( -one => $taxa, -many => $matrix );


=cut

	sub remove_link {
		my $self = shift;
		my %opt  = @_;
		my ( $one, $many ) = ( $opt{'-one'}, $opt{'-many'} );
		if ($one) {
			my $id       = $one->get_id;
			my $relation = $relationship[$id];
			return if not $relation;
			delete $relation->{$many->get_id};
		}
		else {
			my $id = $many->get_id;
		  LINK_SEARCH: for my $relation (@relationship) {
				if ( exists $relation->{$id} ) {
					delete $relation->{$id};
					last LINK_SEARCH;
