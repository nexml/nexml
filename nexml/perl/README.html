<p>
This subdirectory contains a release candidate for Bio::Phylo
with nexml parser support.
</p>
<p>
To build this, you may want to get several optional prerequisites
from CPAN first:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>SVG.pm</li>
    <li>XML::LibXML</li>
    <li>IO::String</li>
    <li>Math::Random</li>
</ul>
<p>
And for the nexml extension you <em>must</em> install XML::Twig
first.
</p>
<p>
The code in this subdirectory is released under the standard
perl licensing scheme, which is a dual system supplying users
a choice between the artistic license and the GNU public license.
</p>
<p>
Provided you have the prerequisites, you can build this code
by issuing:<br/>
<code>$ perl Makefile.PL</code><br/>
<code>$ make</code><br/>
Which places the built code in a 'blib' subdirectory of this
folder.
</p>
<p>To run the test suite (which might fail at this stage of the development), issue:<br/>
<code>$ make test</code><br/>
For NeXML tests, set environment variable NEXML_ROOT to the checked out 
trunk/nexml folder of the nexml project. For BioPerl tests, set environment
variable BIOPERL_LIVE_ROOT to the checked trunk/bioperl-live folder. 
</p>
<p>
To install (but don't do that just yet, instead point your $PERL5LIB
to the lib/ folder), issue:<br/>
<code>$ make install</code><br/>
</p>
<p>
For examples of validation and translation, check out the full source tree
from <a href="http://sf.net/projects/nexml">the sourceforge project</a> and
peruse nexml/validator.cgi and nexml/nex2xml.cgi, respectively.
