the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and
RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will
be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and
inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to establish
such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology representation
languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the...},

	abstract = {In the eight years since phylogenomics was introduced as the intersection of genomics and phylogenetics, the field has provided fundamental insights into gene function, genome history and organismal relationships. The utility of phylogenomics is growing with the increase in the number and diversity of taxa for which whole genome and large transcriptome sequence sets are being generated. We assert that the synergy between genomic and phylogenetic perspectives in comparative biology would be enhanced by the development and refinement of minimal reporting standards for phylogenetic analyses. Encouraged by the development of the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) standard, we propose a similar roadmap for the development of a Minimal Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) standard. Key in the successful development and implementation of such a standard will be broad participation by developers of phylogenetic analysis software, phylogenetic database developers, practitioners of phylogenomics, and journal editors.},

On behalf of this task group, we here present GraphML (Graph Markup Language), an XML format for graph structures, as an initial step towards this goal. Its main characteristic is a unique mechanism that allows to define extension modules for additional data, such as graph drawing information or data specific to a particular application. These modules can freely be combined or stripped without affecting the graph structure, so that information can be added (or omitted) in a well-defined way.},

Public blocks (those containing information utilized by several programs) house information about taxa, morphological and molecular characters, distances, genetic codes, assumptions, sets, trees, etc., private blocks contain information of relevance to single programs.

Although molecular phylogenetic trees are fundamental data structures in evolutionary analysis, the database prepared so that to store the moleculer phylogenetic tree announced systematically and it can look it up didn't exist. In this research we develop a system which stores molecular phylogenetic tree data by a form based on XML. By adopting XML, we can handle not only the data themselves of molecular phylogenetic trees but also the additonal information related to the molecular phylogenetic trees such as their bibliographic information. It becomes possible to do with flexibly addition of the information about the new relations and functions which are obtained by the development of molecular evolution analysis. In this paper, we introduce the way to express the molecular phylogenetic tree data by using XML and explain about the way of reffering to the database.},

	abstract = {Background
The evolutionary analysis of molecular sequence variation is a statistical enterprise. This is reflected in the increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular population genetics. Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data are implemented.

Results
BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of Java source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides models for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence data, statistical alignment and a wide range of options for prior distributions. BEAST source code is object-oriented, modular in design and freely available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ webcite under the GNU LGPL license.

Conclusion
BEAST is a powerful and flexible evolutionary analysis package for molecular sequence variation. It also provides a resource for the further development of new models and statistical methods of evolutionary analysis.},
