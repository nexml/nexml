the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and
RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will
be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and
inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to establish
such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology representation
languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the...},
