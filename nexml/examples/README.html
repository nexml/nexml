    This subdirectory contains nexml documents. These example files are non-normative, they
    are just meant to illustrate some of the facilities of the nexml specification. At present,
    they reference the schema by a relative path: ../xsd/nexml.xsd. To validate them, you
    therefore need to have the schema itself too. The way we have it set up is to check out
    the full nexml head revision from <a href="/nexml/html/index/svn">the subversion repository</a>,
    and then open the files in a schema aware xml editor. We use the 
    <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">oXygen</a> xml plugin for 
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> to edit xml, but there are of course many others.
